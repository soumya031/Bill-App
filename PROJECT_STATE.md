## 1. Executive Summary & Core Philosophy

The vision set forth by the 118-page specification is clear and explicit:
> **"Do not build this as a CRUD invoice application. Build it as a transaction-based business management system where invoices, payments, inventory, tax, and accounting are connected through a reliable source-of-truth ledger."**

### Core Tenets:
1. **Source of Truth Ledger Engine:** Financial figures (Sales, Receivables, Payables, Cash, Bank, COGS, Stock Value, Gross Profit, Net Profit) are **never hardcoded or casually incremented**. Every transaction creates atomic double-entry ledger entries and stock movements.
2. **Offline-First Resilience:** Invoices and billing never pause if internet fails. Local SQLite is the local database with an offline sync queue, idempotency keys, and crash recovery.
3. **Indian Business Workflows:** Native GST compliance (CGST/SGST/IGST, HSN/SAC codes, Composition scheme, Inter vs. Intra-state detection), Indian digit grouping, paise-level integer accuracy (never floating-point errors), thermal printing (58mm/80mm), WhatsApp invoice sharing, and multiple Indian languages.
4. **Data Preservation & Soft Delete:** Financial history is never erased. Transactions are voided/cancelled/reversed with audit trails. Master data is soft-deleted (`inactive = 1`).

---

## 2. Current Architecture & Tech Stack

### Client (Flutter Mobile Application):
- **Framework:** Flutter 3.x / Dart 3.x (targeting Android-first, scalable to desktop/web).
- **Design System:** Material 3 with customized `StitchColors` and `StitchTheme` (Google Fonts Inter, rounded cards, elevation hierarchy).
- **State Management:** `Provider` with reactive `Session` and `SyncEngine`.
- **Local Persistence:** `sqflite` (Android/iOS) and `sqflite_common_ffi` (Desktop/Test).
- **Database File:** `ledger_pilot.db` (Schema Version 1, 20 relational tables).
- **Financial Arithmetic:** `Money` domain class (paise integer storage, formatted with ₹ and Indian comma placement `₹1,00,000.00`).

### Backend (Node.js & Fastify API):
- **Runtime:** Node.js v24, TypeScript, Fastify v5.
- **ORM / Database:** Prisma ORM targeting SQLite (`dev.db`) / PostgreSQL ready.
- **Validation & Auth:** Zod schemas, JWT access tokens, bcrypt password hashing.
- **API Surface:** `/api/v1/auth`, `/api/v1/businesses`, `/api/v1/customers`, `/api/v1/products`, `/api/v1/invoices`, `/api/v1/sync/push`.

   - `backend/src/services/db.ts` imports `@prisma/client`, but `@prisma/client` is missing from `node_modules`. Running `npm test` throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
2. **CSV Import Price Calculation Bug (`import_screen.dart:44`):**
   - Code: `(double.tryParse(r[1].toString()) ?? 0 * 100).round()`
   - Due to operator precedence, `??` binds looser than `*`. A price of 50 becomes 50 paise (₹0.50) instead of 5000 paise (₹50.00). Must be `((double.tryParse(...) ?? 0) * 100).round()`.
3. **Dashboard Metric Headers Bug (`dashboard_screen.dart:508`):**
   - `_SnapshotValue` hardcodes `const Text('Sales', ...)` instead of using the passed `label` variable. This causes Sales, Purchases, and Expenses to all be labeled "Sales" on the dashboard.
4. **Order & Challan Conversion Placeholders (`transaction_history_screen.dart:88,93`):**
   - Clicking "Convert" on Sales Orders or Delivery Challans shows a dummy placeholder message instead of creating the invoice.
5. **Global Search Inaction on Customer & Product (`search_screen.dart:60`):**
   - Clicking a customer or product search result does nothing. Only invoices navigate.

### 🟡 Logic & Code Quality Improvements:
1. **Enforce Customer Credit Limit:** Warning/block when creating a credit invoice exceeding customer credit limit.
2. **Auto-Populate Due Date from Customer Payment Terms:** When a customer with `paymentTermsDays = 30` is selected, default due date should be `today + 30 days`.
3. **Search in Product Picker:** When billing, the item picker has no search bar, making it difficult to select items from large catalogs.

### 🟢 Phase 1: Foundation Stability & Dual-Database Schema Parity (Immediate)
> **Goal:** Eliminate existing crashes, align cloud schema with mobile schema, and fix all discovered foundation bugs so both platforms speak the exact same data language.

- [x] **Task 1.1: Backend Environment & Prisma Recovery**
  - Fix `@prisma/client` missing module error in `backend/`.
  - Install dependencies and generate Prisma Client (`prisma generate`).
  - Run initial SQLite migration for `dev.db` (`prisma db push` / `prisma migrate`).
  - Verify that `npm test` passes 100% clean.
- [x] **Task 1.2: Backend Schema Alignment (Full Parity with Mobile SQLite)**
  - Expand `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` to include missing entities present in the mobile database:
    - `Supplier`, `Purchase`, `PurchaseItem`
    - `Quotation`, `QuotationItem`
    - `SalesOrder`, `SalesOrderItem`
    - `PurchaseOrder`, `PurchaseOrderItem`
    - `DeliveryChallan`, `DeliveryChallanItem`
    - `Return`, `ReturnItem`
    - `BankAccount`, `UnitConversion`, `Batch`, `SerialNumber`
  - Re-generate Prisma Client to ensure backend models match the 20 mobile tables.
- [x] **Task 1.3: Mobile Foundation Bug Fixes**
  - **Dashboard Metric Title Bug:** In `dashboard_screen.dart` (`_SnapshotValue`), replace hardcoded `'Sales'` with `label` so Purchases and Expenses display correctly.
  - **CSV Import Math Bug:** In `import_screen.dart`, fix operator precedence in price parsing: change `(double.tryParse(...) ?? 0 * 100).round()` to `((double.tryParse(...) ?? 0) * 100).round()`.
  - **Search Screen Navigation Bug:** In `search_screen.dart`, wire customer tap to `CustomerDetailScreen` and product tap to product edit/view.
